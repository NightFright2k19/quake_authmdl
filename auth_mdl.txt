I N S T A L L A T I O N
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VANILLA + CUSTOM PORTS (MARK V, QUAKESPASM ETC):
1) Unzip the contents of this zipfile into your Quake installation dir.
2) Rename the "z" letter in the three "pakz.pak" files so they have the highest number in your 
   "id1", "hipnotic" and "rogue" subdirs.
   [Example: Rename "pakz.pak" to "pak2.pak" if you just have "pak0.pak" and "pak1.pak".]
3) If you also want the progs.dat fixes (OPTIONAL):
   a) Copy the subdirs from the "codefixes" folder to your Quake directory.
   b) Rename the "zz" letters in the three "pakzz.pak" files so they have the highest number in your 
      "id1", "hipnotic" and "rogue" subdirs.
      [Example: Rename "pakzz.pak" to "pak3.pak" if you have "pak0.pak", "pak1.pak" and "pak2.pak".]
4) Launch the game and enjoy.

QUAKE ENHANCED (NIGHTDIVE PORT):
1) Unzip the contents of this zipfile into your Steam installation dir of Quake Enhanced.
   Default dir: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Quake\rerelease 
2) Rename the "z" letter in the three "pakz.pak" files so they have the highest number in your 
   "id1", "hipnotic" and "rogue" subdirs. In this case, it would always be "pak1.pak".
3) IMPORTANT: Do *NOT* copy over any external progs.dat files (pakzz.pak) to avoid problems!
4) Launch the game through Steam. 
5) Make sure "Enhanced Models" are turned OFF in the menu (under "Options" > "Display"). 
   [Ammo/health items and explosive boxes will be replaced regardless of any selected option.]
