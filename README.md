# AUTHENTIC MODELS FOR QUAKE

A collection of replacement models which stay true to the classic Quake experience. Several assets are
taken from the Quake Remaster, converted from MD5 to MDL. However, many entries (especially the BSP models and
content from the mission packs) remain exclusive and enhance visuals beyond of what the Nightdive port
can provide.
